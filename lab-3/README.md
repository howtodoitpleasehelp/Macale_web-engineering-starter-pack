# Cherry Blossom Pathfinding Visualizer

A beautiful and interactive A* pathfinding visualizer with a Japanese cherry blossom (sakura) theme. Watch as the algorithm explores through a masked image while cherry blossom petals gracefully fall in the background.

## Features

### Pathfinding Visualization
- Interactive grid-based A* pathfinding algorithm
- Place start and end points anywhere on the grid
- Draw walls to create obstacles
- Watch the algorithm explore in real-time
- See the shortest path when found
- Statistics showing path length and nodes explored

### Cherry Blossom Theme
- Falling cherry blossom petals animation
- Multiple petal shapes and sizes
- Natural swaying and rotation effects
- Soft pink color palette
- Frosted glass UI elements
- Japanese-inspired design elements

### Image Reveal Mechanic
- Hidden background images from a collection
